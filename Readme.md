# Credit Spreads and Market Volatility Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **credit spreads** (proxied by the LQD ETF) and **market volatility** (VIX) from 2015 to the present.  
Understanding this relationship helps investors assess market risk and make informed investment decisions.

## Data Sources
- **LQD ETF**: iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (Yahoo Finance)  
- **VIX**: CBOE Volatility Index (Yahoo Finance)  

Data is pulled programmatically using the `quantmod` package in R.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Download daily closing prices for LQD and VIX.  
2. **Data Preparation**: Merge time series, calculate daily log returns, and clean missing values.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Summary statistics and time series visualizations.  
4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Compute correlation between VIX and LQD.  
   - Perform linear regression of LQD on VIX.  
   - Estimate robust standard errors using `sandwich` and `lmtest`.  
5. **Visualization**:
   - Time series plots of LQD and VIX.  
   - Scatter plot with regression line.

### Summary of Findings
- LQD and VIX exhibit a positive correlation.  
- Linear regression shows that increases in VIX are associated with higher LQD values.  
- Robust standard errors confirm the statistical significance of the relationship.
